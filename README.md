Project Miniverse is the project from my time at Hackbright Academy. It is a site that allows users to share and visualize low resolution 3D printable files. Once a file is uploaded the user can view and interact with a 3D representation of their 3D model. Users can upload renderings or photos of their creations. All users can search all files in the Miniverse. Users can optionally share their 3D models by giving permission for other users to download them.
